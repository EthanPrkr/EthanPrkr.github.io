With a web development background that dates back to high school and cybersecurity being the focus of my collegiate studies, I'm a big fan of anything computers. I'm currently seeking out my CompTIA Sec+ certification and looking to learn anything and everything.

Outside of professional activities I enjoy running, old video games (particularly from the Xbox 360 era), any genre of music, hanging out with my buddies, and I'm currently suffering from a crippling addiction to following geopolitics and philosophy.

I'm looking to develop my cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and software development skills. This site serves as a medium to share what I've learned and motivate me to keep digging. I hope the information stored on this blog helps.
