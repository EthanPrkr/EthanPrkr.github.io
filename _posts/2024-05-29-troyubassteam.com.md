Website for the Troy University Bass Fishing team that displays information about the team roster, some marketing material to build interest and encourage other talented anglers to join, and displays sponsor logos.

This is one I developed back in my freshman year of college. I obviously didn't think to compress the images, they load incredibly slow.

*I do not maintain or manage this website anymore.*
