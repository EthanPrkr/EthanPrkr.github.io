In the process of studying up for the CompTIA Sec+, and figured it would be a good idea to share my notes for whoever is in the same boat. I hope these are useful to someone, and shout-out to Obsidian.md for being an incredibly handy and easy-on-the-eyes mardown editor. Link to my GitHub repo with the notes below:
